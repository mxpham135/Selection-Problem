# Select-Kth-Value
Given a list of n numbers, the Selection Problem is to find the kth smallest element in the list.

## Algorithms
### MergeSort
Sort the list and then return the kth smallest element. This algorithm takes 0(nlogn) complexity.
### Iterative Quicksort  
Implement QuickSort using iterative. This algorithm best case complexity of O(n) and worst case complexity of O(n^2). 
### Recursive Quicksort 
Implement QuickSort using recursive. This algorithm also have best case complexity of O(n) and worst case complexity of O(n^2). 
### Recursive Quicksort with mm rule
Implement QuickSort using recursive with partition at MM (Median of Medians) rule. The last program has the worst case complexity of O(n).
